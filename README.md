# UniVie-Android-Studio-StudyApp-TeamProject

The Study App was required from University of Vienna as a team Project for the subject Person-Computer-Interaction SS2021, so in Team of 4 People we needed to make an App, which is a better version of the website https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/index.html, which is a official website for the University and every student can find an information about the subjects, terms, proffesors and many more. So we made an app, which helps the students. 
The Design (front-end part) war entirely designed and implemented from me, and also some back end changes and improvements!
